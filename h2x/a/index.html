<h2>Journey curation tool instructions</h2>

Thank you for helping us work to improve the Search experience for journeys
such as "student loan forgiveness".  Below you will find more information about
this project, and instructions on how to help us deconstruct journeys.<p>

<h3>Background</h3>

For complex and important topics such as <b>[how to pay for college]</b> or
<b>[how to get student loan forgiveness]</b>, Google search results are
dependent on the student knowing what to search for, and students don't always
search effectively.  Even when they do, the search results often show a variety
of articles on the topic, each one with a different perspective. This can be
overwhelming for students and lead to them not getting the information they
need. (<a id="link"
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+student+loan+forgiveness&pws=0&gl=us&gws_rd=cr"
target=_blank>example search results</a>).<p>

Our goal is to guide the user (student) through these complex topics. To do
that, we need to <b>unpack these topics into a set of subtopics</b> (bite-sized
pieces). Sometimes these subtopics can be further unpacked to create a hierarchy of
subtopics, like a table-of-contents of the topic. We want to focus on these
principles:<ul> <li> Subtopics for exploration rather than
prescriptive steps or instructions, and <li> Understandable more than
comprehensive. </ul><p>

To guide the user, for each subtopic, we also want to provide a <b>well-chosen Google
search query</b> whose search results provide high-quality information on the
subtopic (through web answers, web results, videos, etc).  We wish to guide students
using just these queries, and let the search pages supply the answers.
For a topic like [student loan forgiveness], in a Google doc, we can assemble
<a href="../queries.png" target=_blank>this example hierarchy</a>
of subtopics and search queries, and turn it
into a Search experience like <b><a class="demolink"
href="../demo/d/01-00.html" target=_blank>this demo</a></b>.
Note the wealth of information on the search pages for each subtopic. This
approach extends to other domains: e.g. for a use case like [how to buy a
house], we can put together <a href="../house.png" target=_blank>this
hierarchy</a> and convert it into <b><a class="demolink"
href="../demo/d/14-00.html" target=_blank>this demo</a></b>.<p>

We would like to ask you to <b>combine your domain expertise with information
from the top web results for each topic</b>, to construct such a hierarchy of
subtopics and search queries. To make this easier, on the <a href="00.html"
target=_blank>next few pages</a>, we have collected the sections listed in the
top results for the query [how to get student loan forgiveness] and other use
cases. Please use these as raw material for your subtopic hierarchies. For a
bird's-eye view, we have partially collapsed the information, but use the
"Expand" link on the top of each page (or the "&#xBB;" links) to see more
details.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>

<li> Make a copy of <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QaPGS90GRlmqh3CMMBfjCKdrlE6gr5oOjhwq1REUP2E/edit?usp=sharing"
target=_blank>this Google doc</a> and share it with us (sitaram@google.com).
This is where you will summarize your ideas at the end of the process.

<li> For use cases in this doc that you are familiar with, please go
through the following steps:<ol>

<li> First take a moment to think about how you would break it down into
subtopics, as you might explain to a user seeking advice.  Feel free to take
scratch notes on your notepad.

<li> Try grouping these points into a hierarchy similar to <a
href="../loan.png" target=_blank>the ones above</a> (ideally 2-3 levels deep,
3-5 subtopics in each list), which might resemble chapters and sections of a book on this topic.

<li> Then look over the <a href="00.html" target=_blank>raw material</a>
extracted from web results on these pages (hit "next" to go through all the use
cases).  Look for subtopics you might have missed, or different ways of organizing
them, and try to improve your hierarchy.

<li> Transcribe your hierarchy for this use case back into your copy of the
Google doc (if you did the work on a notepad).

<li> For each subtopic (at every level of the hierarchy), identify a
good search query, and <a href="../queries.png" target=_blank>add it after a
slash ("/")</a> after the subtopic.  For this, try Googling a few search
queries that you think are reasonable for that topic, and capture which one
seems to have useful information on the search results page. (You don't have
to read the webpages).

<li> Proceed to the next use case.
</ol>

<li> Please make sure you shared the doc with sitaram@google.com.
