Hello focus group participant,
<p>
Thank you for participating in this study.
<ol>
<li> For complex and important topics that students encounter, for example
<b>how to pay for college</b>, <b>how to calculate cost of college</b>, or
<b>how to get student loan forgiveness</b>, (more topics listed below),
sometimes Google search results are only moderately useful today. They show a
number of different
articles on the topic, but often each one brings in a different perspective -
such as a different number of options for how to proceed (from 5, 8, to 80
different ways in the case of student loan forgiveness).  Digesting these
articles to distill the key ideas and form a single coherent mental model takes
time and experience, which many users (in this case mostly students) often lack.
This leads to students getting overwhelmed and not getting the information
they need. <a
id="link" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+student+loan+forgiveness&pws=0&gl=us&gws_rd=cr"
target=_blank>Check out this example search page</a>.

<li> We think it would be helpful for Google to guide the user through these
complex topics. For that, we want to <b>unpack such topics into a set of
subtopics</b> for the user to digest in bite-sized pieces.  Some of these
topics are themselves complex, and should be further decomposed to create a
hierarchy of subtopics.  These subtopics may be key questions to think about,
or a breakdown of options, or the basic steps to follow, or a combination of
these. They need to be subtopics to explore rather than prescriptive
instructions. They need to be understandable rather than comprehensive, e.g. a
hierarchy of depth 2 or 3, with 4-5 subtopics per level would be ideal.  There
may not be one right way to break down a topic, and that is okay. For example,
for student loan forgiveness, there are a few main paths: repayment-plan
based options, career-based options, etc. Students also commonly ask questions
such as "do I qualify" and "where to sign up" that make sense to include.
Career-based options further break down into programs for nurses, teachers,
military, etc. <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="treelink">See this example
hierarchy</a>.
<div class="treebox">
<b>How to get student loan forgiveness</b>
<ul>
<li> Career-based
<ul>
<li> Public service
<li> Teacher
<li> Nurse
<li> Doctor or lawyer
<li> Military
<li> Employer-based
<li> Volunteering
</ul>
<li> Repayment-based
<ul>
<li> Income-based
<li> Income-contingent
<li> Pay as you earn
<li> Revised pay as you earn
</ul>
<li> State-based
<li> Discharge
<li> Do I qualify
<li> Where do I sign up
</ul>
(<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="treelink">hide</a>)
</div>

<li> Besides showing users the hierarchy of subtopics, for each
subtopic we would also like to guide the user to a <b>well-chosen Google search query</b>
whose search results provide high-quality information on that subtopic.  This usually
involves trying out a few different queries and tweaking the choice of query terms until
the search page (including web results, the answer panel, etc.) collectively represents
useful information. For example, for the option "nurse", a search query that
brings up a useful search result page is <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=student+loan+forgiveness+programs+for+nurses&pws=0&gl=us&gws_rd=cr"
target=_blank>student loan forgiveness programs for nurses</a>.

<li> By linking to a query, we
can enable the user to <b>go deeper into each subtopic</b> if they wish, by leveraging
Google Search to return a diverse set of high-quality articles, videos, and
other Search features for each query, instead of sending the user to a single article for
the entire topic.  Putting these subtopics and queries together, the Search
experience for student loan forgiveness could, for example, look like <b><a
class="demolink" href="../demo/d/01-00.html" target=_blank>this demo</a></b>.

<li> We would like to combine your domain expertise with information from the
top 20 web results for each topic, to construct this hierarchy of subtopics and
the search queries. To make this easier, <a href="00.html" target=_blank>on the
next page</a>, we have collected the sections listed in the top 20 results for
the query "how to get student loan forgiveness".  For a birds-eye view, we have
partially collapsed the information, but use the "Expand" link on the top of
each page (or the "&#xBB;" links) to see more details.

<li> To capture your work, we would like to ask you to make a copy of <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QaPGS90GRlmqh3CMMBfjCKdrlE6gr5oOjhwq1REUP2E/edit?usp=sharing"
target=_blank>this Google doc</a>, and share it with us
(sitaram@google.com).  For each use case listed in the doc, please look at
the raw material from web results, then step back and think about how you would
explain it to a student seeking advice. Then try to formulate a hierarchical breakdown of
subtopics.  For each subtopic, please try out a few search queries that you think are
reasonable, and try to find one that returns the most useful information. We have
done the first one as an example, but please feel free to replace or improve
that one as well, in addition to the others.
</ol>

Thank you,<br>
Education team, Google.
