Hello focus group participant,
<p>
Thank you for participating in this study.
<ol>
<li> For complex and important topics that students encounter, for example
<b>how to pay for college</b>, <b>how to calculate cost of college</b>, or
<b>how to get student loan forgiveness</b>, (more topics listed below),
sometimes Google search results are only moderately useful today. They show a
number of different
articles on the topic, but often each one brings in a different perspective -
such as a different number of options for how to proceed (from 5, 8, to 80
different ways in the case of student loan forgiveness).  Digesting these
articles to distill the key ideas and form a single coherent mental model takes
time and experience, which many users (in this case mostly students) often lack.
This leads to students getting overwhelmed and not getting the information
they need. <a
id="link" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+student+loan+forgiveness&pws=0&gl=us&gws_rd=cr"
target=_blank>Check out this example search page</a>.

<li> We think it would be helpful for Google to guide the user through these
complex topics. For that, we want to <b>unpack such topics into a set of
subtopics</b> for the user to digest in bite-sized pieces.  Some of these
topics are themselves complex, and should be further decomposed to create a
hierarchy of subtopics.  These subtopics may be key questions to think about,
or a breakdown of options, or the basic steps to follow, or a combination of
these. They need to be subtopics for the user to explore rather than prescriptive
instructions. They need to be understandable more than comprehensive, e.g. a
hierarchy of depth 2 or 3, with 4-5 subtopics in each list might be ideal.  We
understand that there may not be one true way to break down a topic, so we are
just looking for your perspective. For example, for student loan forgiveness,
there are a few main paths: repayment-plan based options, career-based options,
etc. Students also commonly ask questions such as "do I qualify" and "where to
sign up" that make sense to include. Career-based options can further break
down into programs for nurses, teachers, military, etc. <a

<div class="treebox">
<b>How to get student loan forgiveness</b>
<ul>
<li> Career-based
<ul>
<li> Public service
<li> Teacher
<li> Nurse
<li> Doctor or lawyer

<li> Where do I sign up
</ul>
(<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="treelink">hide</a>)
</div>

<li> Besides just showing users the hierarchy of subtopics, for each
subtopic we would also like to guide the user to a <b>well-chosen Google search query</b>
whose search results provide high-quality information on that subtopic. This
usually involves trying out a few different queries and tweaking the choice of
query terms until the search page (including web results, the answer panel,
etc.) collectively represents useful information. For example, for the option
"nurse" in the hierarchy, a search query that brings up a useful search result
page may be <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=student+loan+forgiveness+programs+for+nurses&pws=0&gl=us&gws_rd=cr"
target=_blank>student loan forgiveness programs for nurses</a>.

<li> By linking to a query, we
can enable the user to <b>go deeper into each subtopic</b> if they wish, by leveraging
Google Search to return a diverse set of high-quality articles, videos, and
other Search features for each query, instead of sending the user to a single article for
the entire topic.  Putting these subtopics and queries together, the Search
experience for student loan forgiveness could, for example, look like <b><a
class="demolink" href="../demo/d/01-00.html">this demo</a></b> (or see <a
class="demolink" href="../demo/d/index.html">all demos</a>).

<li> We would like to ask you to <b>combine your domain expertise with information from the
top 20 web results for each topic</b>, to construct this hierarchy of subtopics and
the search queries. To make this easier, <a href="00.html" target=_blank>on the
next few pages</a>, we have collected the sections listed in the top 20 results
for the query "how to get student loan forgiveness" and for the other use
cases. Please use this as raw material for your subtopic hierarchies. For a
bird's-eye view, we have partially collapsed the information, but use the
"Expand" link on the top of each page (or the "&#xBB;" links) to see more
details.

<li> To capture your work, we would like to ask you to <b>make a copy of <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QaPGS90GRlmqh3CMMBfjCKdrlE6gr5oOjhwq1REUP2E/edit?usp=sharing"
target=_blank>this Google doc</a></b>, and share it with us
(sitaram\@google.com).  For each use case listed in the doc, please look at the
raw material from web results, and see if you spot patterns, or can select,
arrange, and rename these entries to match your mental model. But then please
step back and think about how you would explain it to a student seeking advice.
Between these, try to formulate a hierarchical breakdown of subtopics for each
use case.  For each subtopic, please try out a few search queries that you
think are reasonable, and try to find one that returns useful information that
you may have been expecting. We have done the first use case (student loan
forgiveness) as an example, but please feel free to replace or improve that one
as well, in addition to looking at the rest.
</ol>

Thank you,<br>
Education team, Google.
